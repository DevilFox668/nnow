Say hello to the mod you NEVER NEEDED OR WANTED.
This mod adds a list of blocks and items that well, you thought you “never needed or wanted”. The mod’s main goal is to be used in a sky block world,
and through the use of the new villagers and berry bushes, make it so you can get everything you would ever need.

## Overview

*8 New Villagers each with the own list trades and workstation.

*30 new berry bushes! Vanilla ores, resources and other modded metals.

*All new Hammers and Spades for all you 3x3 mining and digging needs.

*The all new and sexy Poking Stick of Doom, OK not sexy or ‘of Doom’ but its still new.

*Derpy Magnet because we all know walking that one extra block to pick something up is just one block to far.

*Villager Intense Area Growing Range Attachment (nothing more to say on that.)

*Super Obsidian and Dark Glass to keep you safe from the evil Wither Boss and his blast.

*4 Mod traps for all your mod killing needs, Each with different traits.

*Water Well, A block with an endless source of water.

*Lava Well, A block with an endless source of lava.

*Cobblestone Generator, A source of Cobblestone, but still with a cost.
